# Increment a Number with JavaScript

- You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the **++** operator.

```js
i++;
```

is the equivalent of
```js
i = i + 1;
```

- Note: The entire line becomes **i++**;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

- Change the code to use the **++** operator on **myVar**.

### Tests
- **myVar** should equal **88**.
- You should not use the assignment operator.
- You should use the **++** operator.
- You should not change code above the specified comment.

# Solution

```js
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
```
